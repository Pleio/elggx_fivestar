1.8.5:

- There're not really any changes. I only forgot to update the version number in activate.php correctly for Elggx Fivestar 1.8.4, so the version 1.8.5 does correct this - by switching directly to 1.8.5...

1.8.4:

- Fix for Elggx Fivestar plugin to work in Elgg 1.8.14 with simple cache enabled.

1.8.3:

- Some general code cleanup,
- Update of simple_html_dom library to latest version,
- Updated the default views (to use them you need to Set/Reset the default views in the Elggx Fivestar plugin configuration in the section "Administer" - "Utilities" - "Elggx Fivestar").

1.8.2:

- French translation added (thank to emanwebdev),
- German translation added.

1.8.1 (by iionly):

- Adding/removing views via the plugin settings page should work now.
(It was necessary to move the plugin settings to the "Administer" - "Utilities" section as the Elgg core save button added automatically on pages in the "Configure" - "Settings" section failed to keep the content of the views array. When upgrading please remove the old Elggx Fivestar folder before copying the files of the new version on your server.)

1.8.0 (by iionly):

- Initial release for Elgg 1.8
